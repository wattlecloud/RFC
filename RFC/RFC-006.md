# RFC-006 - Electronic Property Filing

All councils in New South Wales are required to digitise all documents related to a property. These are currently held in large shelving at each council. Rather than force a traditional document management system to handle the use case, Temora Shire Council proposes to purpose built a system to properly handle the use case.

These documents are filed against a sub-division, this changes as land parcels and divided or combined.

Documents are generally filed against:
- A function, such as a general correspondence, sewer diagram
- An application such as a development application for an extension

This is completely a back office function with no customer facing interfaces proposed at this stage.

# Functional requirements

At it's core the feature aims to provide a purpose built electronic document filing system aimed at addressing the need of maintaining an electronic copy of all property related files.

Property files are stored against the true representation of a property, that Wattle is already aware of, these are identified by an Lot, Section and Deposited Plan which is linked to a street address.

## Navigation and Searching

The user will primarily locate a subdivision before accessing the documents. It's proposed that we use a full text search engine to index the property and file related meta data.

The user will enter either Lot/Section/DP (complete or partial) or autocomplete a street address.

The user is presented with the matching properties, the user will select a property to access/manage files and/or use the collaboration features.

## Categorisation of Content

The files are categorised using a pre-defined set of folders (i.e General correspondence) or by creating one in particular to development application.

Development application related folders follow the pattern `YYYY/NN` where `YYYY` is the year followed by a `NN` number generated by the NSW Planning Portal.

These two section should be grouped to indicate they are distinct.

Particular folders will be available for integration, see later stage of the RFC.
