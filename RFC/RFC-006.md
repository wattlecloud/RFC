# RFC-006 - Electronic Property Filing

| | |
-- | --
Proposed by | Temora Shire Council
Developed by | Anomaly Software Pty Ltd
Initiated by | Kristopher Dunstan

All councils in New South Wales are required to digitise all documents related to a property. These are currently held in large shelving at each council. Rather than force a traditional document management system to handle the use case, Temora Shire Council proposes to purpose built a system to properly handle the use case.

These documents are filed against a sub-division, this changes as land parcels and divided or combined.

Documents are generally filed against:
- A function, such as a general correspondence, sewer diagram
- An application such as a development application for an extension

This is completely a back office function with no customer facing interfaces proposed at this stage.

Dependency | Required
-- | --
Has a customer facing interface | ❌ No
Provides a backoffice workflow | ✅ Yes
Payments | ❌ No
Send SMS messages | ❌ No
Send Email via SMTP | ✅ Yes
Large object store | ✅ Yes
Geo features | ❌ No

# Functional requirements

At it's core the feature aims to provide a purpose built electronic document filing system aimed at addressing the need of maintaining an electronic copy of all property related files.

Property files are stored against the true representation of a property, that Wattle is already aware of, these are identified by an Lot, Section and Deposited Plan which is linked to a street address.

## Navigation and Searching

The user will primarily locate a subdivision before accessing the documents. It's proposed that we use a full text search engine to index the property and file related meta data.

The user will enter either Lot/Section/DP (complete or partial) or autocomplete a street address.

The user is presented with the matching properties, the user will select a property to access/manage files and/or use the collaboration features.

### Summary

When a set of search results are displayed, the following information should be presented:

- Date and User that last interacted with the property file
- Number of objects across the property file, grouped by the folder name?
- Links to pinned items
- Last comment left against a file

## Categorisation of Content

The files are categorised using a pre-defined set of folders (i.e General correspondence) or by creating one in particular to development application.

Development application related folders follow the pattern `YYYY/NN` where `YYYY` is the year followed by a `NN` number generated by the NSW Planning Portal.

These two section should be grouped to indicate they are distinct.

Particular folders will be available for integration, see later stage of the RFC.

Administrators of the system will be able to manage the fixed folder structure. The system should guide the user in creating the Development Application related folders by enforcing the naming convention.

## Filing property documents

Upon identifying a folder or having created one, the user will be presented 


### Pin to top

## Logging

Each activity against a folder or a file eg:

- Creation of a folder
- Upload of a document

is required to be logged and displayed as a chronological set of events.

This provides a clarity on how the matter has been dealt with between various staff members.

## Commenting


## Send to Owner


## Reminders

The council is required to follow up on various correspondence 


## iAuditor integration

iAuditor is an application made by SafetyCulture, it's a rather popular platform for creating and executing forms for inspections.

Temora Shire Council proposes to use their platform to conduct building and property inspections (also reference [RFC-005](RFC-005.md)), it's intended that a copy of the result is filed against a particular folder.

SafetyCulture provide an [API](https://developer.safetyculture.io) for their platform and could be used to achieve this integration.

## Removal of documents
