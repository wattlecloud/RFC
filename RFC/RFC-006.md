# RFC-006 - Electronic Property Filing

All councils in New South Wales are required to digitise all documents related to a property. These are currently held in large shelving at each council. Rather than force a traditional document management system to handle the use case, Temora Shire Council proposes to purpose built a system to properly handle the use case.

These documents are filed against a sub-division, this changes as land parcels and divided or combined.

Documents are generally filed against:
- A function, such as a general correspondence, sewer diagram
- An application such as a development application for an extension
