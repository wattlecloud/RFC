# RFC-003 - Membership management

Role | Executor
| -- | -- |
Proposed by | Kristopher Dunstan, Temora Shire Council
Designed and Developed by | Anomaly Software Pty Ltd

The original proposal came from Temora Shire council, wanting to automate membership management of their recreation centre. The current solution involves maintaining manual ledgers, accepting payments (over the phone or in person) and updating the access control system.

The proposed solution will broadly cover the following:
- A web based backend that allows managing members and their memberships
- Payment integration via Stripe to automate accepting payments and ultimately automate renewal
- A customer facing web interface allowing them to manage their memberships
- Integration with the access control system (primarily [Gallagher](https://gallaghersecurity.github.io) via their REST API)
