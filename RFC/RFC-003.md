# RFC-003 - Membership management

Role | Executor
| -- | -- |
Proposed by | Kristopher Dunstan, Temora Shire Council
Designed and Developed by | Anomaly Software Pty Ltd

The original proposal came from Temora Shire council, wanting to automate membership management of their recreation centre. The current solution involves maintaining manual ledgers, accepting payments (over the phone or in person) and updating the access control system.

The proposed solution will broadly cover the following:
- A web based backend that allows managing members and their memberships
- Payment integration via Stripe to automate accepting payments and ultimately automate renewal
- A customer facing web interface allowing them to manage their memberships
- Integration with the access control system (primarily [Gallagher](https://gallaghersecurity.github.io) via their REST API)

> Gallagher has extensive SDKs for all platforms,  including mobile platforms, which allows creation of apps with NFC based tokens.

# Assumptions

Memberships will be managed via Stripe, due to their rich set of features. It's assumed that anyone using this module will provision a Stripe account.

# Catalogue of memberships

The organisation will offer a set of memberships, across various facilities. Memberships can be recurring or single use.

E.g: a recurring membership to a swimming pool, or a one time pass to use concert hall.

A membership type may or may not have a cost associated with it.

These products will be provisioned on Stripe and the system will maintain a reflection of the data.

# Backoffice

The first component to be developed will be a back office module that will allow users of the organisation to create new members and manage their memberships.

> Members created by this module will eventually be a user of the system, the design should accommodate this.

The organisation user creates a new member, or uses a search functionality to find an existing member.

The system presents a list of their current and historical memberships, including renewals.

The user is then able to:
- Renew their membership
- Start a new membership
- Cancel a membership (note we will have to outline the rules around cancellation)
- Vary their membership i.e go from a monthly plan to an annual plan

Payments will be processed through Stripe. 

> At the moment Wattle uses Stripe Connect, we will be moving away from this so each council can have their own managed setup.

# Customer facing interfaces

The customer can either create a service account to access the various online services, or if the customer has already been provisioned on the systems then the council can send out an invite via the system for the customer to take control of their account.

The customer is then presented by an interface where they can manage their memberships and update their payment methods.

# Gallagher integration

Gallagher are a New Zealand based maker of security products. Their control centre has a RESTful API that allows provisioning of security cards, allowing access to various facilities.

The aim of this integration is to automatically push the access control rules to the control centre.

> The control centre lives on the physical premises, either a bot will have to poll data or the web infrastructure will have to find  away to communicate over a VPN.

Rules around how often the system will push the rules to the control centre will need to be defined.
